/*
Pure Function: A function that always produces the same output given the same input and has no side effects.
*/

/*
Immutability: Data cannot be modified after it is created. Instead, new data is created.
*/

/*
First-Class Functions: Functions can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.
*/

/*
Higher-Order Function: A function that takes another function as an argument or returns a function.
